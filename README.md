# codingNote
This is a new repository for my studying notes.

Recently i am working on Javascript to strengthen my skills!

This note is for watch the YouTube course " JavaScript Tutorial for Beginners:Learn JavaScript in 1 Hour" by "Programming with Mosh". I learnt a lot from this short course and it helped me pick up the main knowledge that i have learnt in coding bootcamp.
